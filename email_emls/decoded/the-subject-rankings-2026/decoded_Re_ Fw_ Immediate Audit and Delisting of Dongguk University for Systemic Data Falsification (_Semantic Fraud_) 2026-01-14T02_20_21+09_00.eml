Dear Gender Watchdog Team,

We have reviewed the allegations raised in relation to Pusan National University, Sogang University, and Konkuk University. Based on our assessment, we do not consider the claims that the alleged misrepresentation of international partnerships has materially influenced THE’s ranking metrics to be supported. 

Please also note that inclusion in the rankings is based on the proviso that a university is deemed to be in good standing by its relevant local regulatory body for higher education.  Complaints about the conduct of universities should be addressed to the relevant regulatory body. Should the status of any university change, THE will act in an appropriate manner.

Thank you for raising these concerns and engage with us. 

Kind regards,

THE Data Team

Dear [Redacted] and the THE Data Team,

Thank you for your prompt clarification regarding Dongguk University. It is revealing that an institution marketing itself domestically as a "Global Leader" effectively holds "Ghost Status" in the THE system. We will update our records to reflect that THE has responsibly distanced itself from this unverified institution.

The "Cop Out": How Partnership Fraud Games Your Methodology However, we respectfully contest the assertion that because THE has "no metric related to partnerships," this fraud is irrelevant to your rankings. Reviewing your World University Rankings 2026 Methodology, "Semantic Fraud" directly manipulates two documented pillars:

Reputation (33% Total Weight):

Mechanism: "Teaching Reputation" (15%) and "Research Reputation" (18%) rely on survey responses.

The Fraud: When Pusan National University (PNU)—which THE ranks—falsely markets a partnership with Harvard University, it manufactures an illegitimate "prestige halo." This biases survey respondents to view them as a global peer of elite institutions, artificially inflating your single largest data block.

International Outlook (7.5%):

Mechanism: Includes "International Staff" and "International Collaboration."

The Fraud: Universities claim these verified partnerships to attract international staff who believe they are joining a globally connected network. The "collaboration" metric is polluted when the infrastructure for that collaboration (the partnership) is fabricated.

Evidence of Contamination in THE-Ranked Universities Our "Systemic Audit" of 28 universities has moved beyond Dongguk. We have detected "Partnership Inflation" at institutions currently ranked by THE:

Pusan National University (Ranked 501-600 in 2025):

Claim: Lists Harvard University, City University of Hong Kong, and Dalian University of Technology.

Audit Status: Not Found in respective public partner lists.

Sogang University (Ranked 1001-1200):

Claim: Lists American University (USA).

Audit Status: Not Found.

Konkuk University (Ranked 601-800):

Claim: Lists Beijing Institute of Technology.

Audit Status: Not Found.

Comparison with QS (Legal Notice Issued) We are currently taking aggressive action against your competitor. We have issued a formal demands letter to QS Rankings (Liability Notice regarding Dongguk University), citing their "Negligent Validation" of 34 falsified partnerships and complicity in student safety breaches (61.5% sexual violence rate in arts). We are preparing to notify 40+ embassies and legal clinics regarding QS's role in this consumer fraud.

Recommendation for THE THE has the opportunity to distinguish itself as the "Gold Standard" for integrity. We recommend:

Targeted Audit: Review the specific "International" data points for Pusan National University and Sogang University given these flagged discrepancies.

Reputation Survey Adjustment: Consider how unchecked "Marketing Fraud" regarding ivy-league partnerships distorts the Academic Reputation Survey results for Korean institutions.

We are happy to share our full raw dataset (~28 universities) to assist your team in cleaning the "Reputation" inputs for the next cycle.

Note: We are copying this correspondence to relevant educational oversight bodies, diplomatic missions, student advocacy organizations, and international education press to ensure transparency in this sector-wide data integrity matter.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog

Dear Gender Watchdog Team,

Thank you for your email and for sharing the details of the issues you have investigated. We have carefully noted the points you raised.

Please note that Dongguk University has never participated in Times Higher Education rankings. As such, we have not collected any data—relevant or otherwise—from Dongguk University, nor do we hold historical data for the institution.

Also, we do not collect data on international partnerships, and there is no metric related to partnerships or MoUs in our rankings methodology. Where we do collect data, we apply a range of validation processes, including outlier analysis, year-on-year comparisons, and public data checks where such sources are available.

While data are submitted directly by universities through our data collection portal, each data point is subject to validation. Where discrepancies or anomalies are identified, we follow up with institutions and request clarification or correction as appropriate.

Given that Dongguk University has never been ranked in any Times Higher Education rankings to date, we are unable take further action at this time. However, we have noted your concerns and findings for consideration in any future activity.

Thank you again for bringing this matter to our attention.

Kind regards,

 Subject: Re: Immediate Audit and Delisting of Dongguk University for Systemic Data Falsification ("Semantic Fraud")

Dear Colleagues,

We are writing to formally submit evidence of widespread data falsification by Dongguk University (South Korea) regarding their international partnership network. This information directly impacts the integrity of your rankings, specifically metrics related to "International Outlook," "Global Engagement," and "Inbound/Outbound Exchange."

Since April 2025, we have attempted to alert your organizations to these discrepancies. Despite claims of being "data-driven," it appears no due diligence has been performed to verify the reciprocity of Dongguk's claimed partnerships.

We have now completed a comprehensive audit exposing 34 false or misrepresented partnerships across North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.

1. The Evidence: "Semantic Fraud" Exposed

Dongguk University is engaging in what we term "Semantic Fraud"—systematically misrepresenting low-level, non-binding MOUs or expired agreements as active, university-wide student exchange partnerships.

Key Findings:

Oceania: 85% of claimed partners (6 out of 7) are false or missing.

China: Major state universities (Beijing Institute of Technology, Wuhan University) do not list Dongguk as a partner, despite Dongguk's claims.

North America: 40% of claimed Canadian partners are confirmed false.

Specific Confirmed Cases:

University of Manitoba (Canada): Explicitly denied the existence of any partnership in writing. (Note: They requested anonymity in the press, but we are disclosing this to you for your internal verification).

University of British Columbia (Canada): After intervention by the BC Information & Privacy Commissioner (OIPC), UBC's FOI office confirmed no active institutional agreement exists.

University of Southampton (UK): Dongguk claims them as a partner. Southampton does not. When queried, Southampton voluntarily forwarded our request to their Freedom of Information (FOI) office, treating the discrepancy as a formal legal matter rather than a simple administrative query.

Beijing Institute of Technology (China): Admitted in writing that while an MOU exists, no student exchange partnership exists. Dongguk lists them as a full exchange partner.

Access the Evidence:

Full Investigative Report: Semantic Fraud: How Dongguk University's Global Network Collapsed

Redacted Evidence Files (FOI Responses & Emails): Proton Drive LinkWe can provide unredacted versions of these documents to your verification teams upon request.

2. The Failure of Due Diligence

We have evidence of reaching out to QS and Times Higher Education multiple times since April 2025 regarding this issue.

It is alarming that your organizations, which influence the decisions of millions of students and the allocation of billions in funding, failed to detect fraud that is easily verifiable.

Automated Verification: Partnership claims can be cross-referenced for reciprocity using simple automated scripts (checking Partner A's list against Partner B's list).

AI Analysis: Current AI tools can process these datasets in seconds.

We request full disclosure on your due diligence procedures:

Why was Dongguk University allowed to submit false partnership data without challenge?
Do you require proof of reciprocity for "International Partnership" metrics?
Why were our previous whistleblower alerts ignored?

3. Systemic Risk & Immediate Action

This is not an isolated incident. We believe this "Semantic Fraud" may be widespread among Korean universities attempting to meet government globalization quotas (e.g., the "Study Korea 300K" initiative).

We urge you to take the following actions immediately:

Immediate Audit: Run automated due diligence checks on all partnership data submitted by Dongguk University (and other Korean universities) against the public partner lists of their claimed global counterparts.

Delist Dongguk University: Dongguk should be suspended or delisted from your rankings immediately. This is necessary to:
Protect your own reputation as a reliable source of data.
Provide official validation for students who are currently trapped in unsafe environments and need to transfer or take legal action.

Issue a Warning: Alert the global academic community to the risks of "Zombie Partnerships" and "MOU Inflation" coming from South Korea.

4. The Human Cost

This is not just about data. It is about student safety. The Korean Ministry of Education has maintained silence on this issue for over 260 days, despite being notified of the Canadian university's denial on April 10, 2025. By inflating their global status, Dongguk lures international students into an environment where we have documented high rates of sexual violence and institutional cover-ups.

Universities are now becoming proactive. Southampton and Beijing Institute of Technology responded to us swiftly because they recognize the liability. We are continuing to build a library of denials from Dongguk's claimed partners.

Do not let your rankings be the shield that protects a fraudulent institution.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Advocacy for Safe Campuses in Korea
