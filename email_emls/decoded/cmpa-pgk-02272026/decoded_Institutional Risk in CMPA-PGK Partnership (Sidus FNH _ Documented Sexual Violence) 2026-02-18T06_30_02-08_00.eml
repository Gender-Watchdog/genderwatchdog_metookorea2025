To Mr. Reynolds Mastin and Mr. Kyle Irving:

We are writing to you regarding the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) and the Producers Guild of Korea (PGK) on December 17, 2025.

This partnership, while intended to modernize co-production treaties, exposes Canadian producers—and specifically Indigenous and equity-seeking creators—to institutions currently documented as central to a "Human Rights & Sexual Violence Crisis."

The Core Risk: Institutional Capture by Predatory Actors Our forensic audit of the Korean film and education sectors reveals that the Producers Guild of Korea is historically and structurally linked to actors who are currently suppressing sexual violence survivors.

1. The Convicted Felon at the Center (Sidus FNH) Tcha Seung-jai (차승재), the three-term President of the Korean Film Producers Association (KFPA) and founder of Sidus FNH, was indicted in June 2015 — while serving as a professor at Dongguk University's Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents — for embezzling approximately 350 million KRW (~CAD $340,000) from government education subsidies routed through a film personnel education institution in Seoul. In his 2017 trial he was acquitted of embezzlement but convicted of bid-rigging in the same government subsidy program — manipulating which vendors received contracts funded by public education money. Dongguk's response: they promoted him — appointing him Research Institute Director in 2020, then elevating him to Dean of the Film & Video Production Department in 2023, six years after his criminal conviction. Indictment Source 1 (Sisafocus, 2015): https://www.sisafocus.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=123718 Indictment Source 2 (Sports World, 2015): https://www.sportsworldi.com/newsView/20150604001257 2023 Dean Appointment (Yonhap): https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230302140300004 Despite this, Sidus FNH remains a power broker. We recently exposed how Tcha's company shared physical facilities with the graduate school, blurring the line between industry recruiter and academic gatekeeper.The Threat: When Gender Watchdog documented this "Academic-Industry Pipeline," Sidus FNH's legal team threatened us with criminal defamation—a standard tool used to silence advocacy in Korea.

2. The Danger to Students ("Quadruple Coercion") The integration of production companies like Sidus FNH into universities creates a "Quadruple Coercion" trap for career-seeking students:Academic Authority: The professor grades them.Corporate Power: The production CEO hires them.Association Presidency: The industry leader can blacklist them.Defamation Law: The legal system criminalizes their truth-telling. Institutional Capture Analysis (Pak Noja): https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/institutional-capture-pak-noja-epstein-model

3. Targeting of Foreign Talent ("Racialized Sexual Violence") The crisis is not just gendered; it is explicitly racialized. Our data shows a "predatory pipeline" targeting international students from China, Vietnam, and the Zainichi Korean community (ethnic Koreans born and raised in Japan, who face layered discrimination in Korea and are often pejoratively labeled gyopo).Zero Foreign Females in Leadership: Despite billions in exports, there are virtually zero foreign women in creative leadership roles in Korean entertainment. They are recruited for their tuition and talent, groomed for "sponsorship," and then erased. Statistical Impossibility Report: https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/the-statistical-impossibility-why-there-are-zero-foreign-women-in-korean-entertainment-leadership/Witness Testimony (Xiaohongshu Forms): Victims have broken their silence on China's "Little Red Book" (Xiaohongshu), detailing how faculty exploit visa vulnerability to coerce foreign students. Viral Victim Testimony: https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/viral-xiaohongshu-post-exposes-dongguk-university-sexual-violence-crisis-victims-break-their-silence/

4. The "Sponsorship" Economy = Grooming Canadian producers must understand that Korea's normalized "Sponsorship" (seu-pon) system mirrors the clinical definition of sexual grooming (Selection → Isolation → Dependence → Control).The Risk for Canadians: Any Canadian talent sent to Korea under this MOU enters an ecosystem where "access" is often gatekept by this grooming mechanism. Sponsorship vs. Grooming Analysis: https://x.com/Gender_Watchdog/status/1966813553140396281Evidence of Cover-Up ("Panic Scrub"): Following our audits, major Korean universities (Dongguk, SNU, Chung-Ang, Sogang) have actively deleted their international partner lists to hide fraudulent partnerships. The "Panic Scrub" Report: https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/panic-scrub-dongguk-deletes-ubc-reverts-to-dead-names/

5. The Statistical Baseline: 61.5% Sexual Violence Rate The Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI 2020)—a Korean government-linked research body—documented a 61.5% sexual violence rate among female students in university arts and culture programs. Film departments scored the highest risk rating (81/100) of all academic disciplines. This is the talent pipeline the CMPA-PGK MOU seeks to access. KWDI Report Context: https://blog.genderwatchdog.org/sexual-violence-in-arts-education-after-me-too-current-status-and-policy-issues/

The Values Contradiction Mr. Irving, as Board Chair and a leader in Indigenous screen sovereignty (Eagle Vision), you understand the importance of ethical partnerships. Partnering with the Producers Guild of Korea—without addressing this documented 61.5% violence rate or the captured nature of its institutions—contradicts the CMPA's stated commitment to equity and safety.

A Note on the MMIWG2S Parallel (To Board Chair Irving): We respect Eagle Vision’s leadership in Indigenous sovereignty. However, the mechanics of "Sponsorship" in Korea—recruiting vulnerable racial minorities, isolating them from legal support, and normalizing their exploitation—mirror the systemic trafficking factors recognized in the MMIWG2S crisis.Grooming is a Crime, Not Culture: The "Sponsorship" defense is often used to mask predatory behavior, but Korean law recognizes grooming as criminal. Case Precedent (Kim Soo-hyun / Grooming Allegations): https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_entertainment/1190087.html

Our Request: Pause and Review We urge the CMPA to:Pause implementation of the Dec 17, 2025 MOU with PGK.Conduct Due Diligence on the "Quadruple Coercion" risks facing Canadian talent in Korea.Meet with Us to review the forensic evidence before formalizing any treaty terms.

We are providing you with this confidential notice for 7 days before we release our full report on the "Canada-Korea Co-Production Risks" to the public and the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

Sincerely,

Gender Watchdog Supported by End Rape On Campus (EROC)
