Dear friends,

Many thanks for sharing these insights. They highlight some major problems that make me worry a lot about reputation-based ranking processes. They are extremely gameable unfortunately and some institutions have become addicted to such gaming.

Best wishes

John

Subject: RE: China ‘marked down’ in retraction-adjusted rankings / The \"Input Side\" of Ranking Fraud (Case Study)

Dear Professor Ioannidis, Mr. Grove, Ms. Bizzozero and others,

We read with great interest the recent analysis in Times Higher Education regarding the "Retraction-Adjusted Rankings"
 and the subsequent penalties for institutions relying on citation gaming and self-citation rings.

Article: China ‘marked down’ in scholar’s retraction-adjusted rankings (THE): https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/china-marked-down-scholars-retraction-adjusted-rankings

As an advocacy group auditing institutional integrity in South Korea, we believe we have identified the "upstream" variable that
 fuels the very citation gaming you are analyzing. We call it "Semantic Fraud."

While your work brilliantly addresses the Output Side of ranking manipulation (e.g., retractions, self-citations),
 our recent audit of Dongguk University exposes the Input Side (e.g., falsified international partnerships).

The Connection: "Prestige Bait" for HiCi Researchers

You note that mid-size institutions in regions like China and Saudi Arabia often game rankings via "hyper-prolific authorship." Our data suggests a causal mechanism for how they
 acquire these authors:

The Fabrication: An institution falsifies partnerships with elite universities (Yale, Russell Group, etc.)
 to create a "Prestige Halo." (We found 34 such falsified partners at Dongguk University alone).
The Bait: They use this fraudulent network to recruit international staff and HiCi researchers, promising
 them a "globally connected" research environment.
The Result: The ranking rises due to the influx of talent, which then generates the problematic citation
 data you are flagging.

A Proposal: The "Institutional Integrity" Adjustment

Just as you propose deducting points for retractions, we argue that ranking methodologies must subtract points for verified
 institutional dishonesty.

If a university claims a partnership with Yale or the University of Manchester that does not exist (as our audit confirmed with Dongguk), that is not just a marketing error—it is an
 illegitimate boost to their International Outlook and Reputation scores.

We would welcome your thoughts on how "Semantic Fraud" data—specifically verified false claims of international connectivity—could be integrated into future iterations of your adjusted
 ranking models.
