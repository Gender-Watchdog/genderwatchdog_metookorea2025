Dear Editors,

Before going viral on Xiaohongshu, Gender Watchdog's posts documenting Title IX sexual violence risks, partnership fraud, and alleged misuse of public funds at Dongguk University had already reached 3,468 views across 22 university galleries on DC Inside. These engagement metrics are transparently tracked on our public dashboard: [https://dashboard.genderwatchdog.org/](https://dashboard.genderwatchdog.org/).

But today, our message resonated on an entirely new scale: on Xiaohongshu, China's leading social media platform, our advocacy about Dongguk University's crisis went viral, reaching a vast mainland Chinese audience and prompting an outpouring of victim testimonies and public engagement.

The Gender Watchdog Research Collective is dedicated to exposing critical failures in South Korea's higher education oversight system, with a focus on risks to international students. Our ongoing advocacy has uncovered systemic issues at Dongguk University—including sexual violence, falsified partnerships, and government inaction—that threaten student safety and institutional integrity. We are now reaching out to the press to ensure these findings receive the urgent attention they deserve, building on our previous documentation and outreach efforts.

# Viral Xiaohongshu Post Exposes Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis: Victims Break Their Silence

Our recent post about Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis has gone viral on Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), China's leading social media platform, generating unprecedented engagement and prompting multiple victims to come forward with their experiences.

## Post Performance Statistics

The post titled "韩检警通报：东国大学合作造假性暴力危机" (Korean Police Report: Dongguk University Partnership Fraud Sexual Violence Crisis) published at [this URL](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/68314964000000002300c6ca?channelType=web_engagement_notification_page&channelTabId=mentions&xsec_token=LBXzYEuRW4arik5YVWfXtktMLDluNkLfHqLLwj7QAwRok=&xsec_source=pc_notice) has achieved remarkable reach:

- **2,921 views** with 20 comments generating intense discussion
- **Multiple victim testimonies** emerging in comment threads
- **Cross-platform amplification** with 3,421 views across 22 university discussion boards on Korean platforms
- **International reach** spanning Korea, Japan, China, and other regions

## Victim Testimonies Emerge

The viral post has created a safe space for victims to share their experiences, revealing a pattern of institutional failure and victim silencing at Dongguk University.

### Theatre Department Self-Censorship: Evidence of Fear and Retaliation

User **callmeJoy** from the theatre studies department initially posted a revealing comment but then edited it, demonstrating the climate of fear surrounding criticism of Dongguk University:

**Original Comment:**
> "波澜背后的痛小透明的哭泣孤独，而且我们大谈特谈feminism。"

*Translation: "Behind all the drama are the silent tears and loneliness of nobodies, while we talk endlessly about feminism."*

![Original comment from theatre student about pain and loneliness behind feminist discussions](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-solidarity-feminism.png)

**Edited Comment:**
> "戏剧学暂时没有认识的男教授，而且我们大谈特谈 Fimines"

*Translation: "Theatre studies currently has no male professors that I know of, and we talk extensively about feminism [or feminist issues]."*

![Edited comment after self-censorship, removing references to pain and suffering](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-no-male-profs-edit.png)

This dramatic self-censorship reveals several critical issues:

1. **Fear of Retaliation**: The commenter removed all references to "pain," "tears," and "loneliness," suggesting fear of being identified and facing consequences for speaking honestly about conditions at the university.

2. **Institutional Intimidation**: The fact that students feel compelled to edit their comments to remove negative experiences demonstrates an atmosphere where criticism is dangerous.

3. **Hidden Suffering**: The original comment reveals that despite feminist discussions in the theatre department, students are experiencing significant emotional distress ("silent tears and loneliness of nobodies").

4. **Performative vs. Real Change**: The juxtaposition of talking "endlessly about feminism" while students suffer in silence suggests that discussions may not translate to actual protection or support for victims.

This self-censorship pattern is common in university environments where speaking out carries risks, and provides crucial evidence of the intimidating atmosphere that silences victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University.

### Personal Interview Misconduct

User **Lucy M** shared her direct experience with Dongguk University faculty:

> "em...我以前读研的时候 面试我的是个东大的教授. 两名里面其中一名 问的问题 就不是面试问题. 有关我个人隐私的 第一直觉告诉我 得跑 录取上后我直接退学了"

*Translation: "When I was applying for graduate school, I was interviewed by a Dongguk professor. One of the two interviewers asked questions that weren't interview questions - they were about my personal privacy. My first instinct told me to run. After being accepted, I directly withdrew."*

![Lucy M's testimony about inappropriate interview questions from Dongguk professor](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-LucyM-inappropriate-questions-dongguk-interview.png?raw=true)

This testimony reveals how sexual misconduct begins at the admissions level, with faculty using their power to ask inappropriate personal questions of prospective female students.

### Ongoing Sexual Violence Against International Students

**愤怒的土豆汤** (Angry Potato Soup) reported recent incidents:

> "上个学期还有个影像大留学生被前辈性骚扰了"

*Translation: "Last semester, a foreign student in the film program was sexually harassed by a senior student."*

![Report of recent sexual harassment of international film student by senior](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-senior-harass-foreign-student-imaging.png?raw=true)

This comment confirms that sexual violence continues to occur against international students in Dongguk's film programs, despite ongoing investigations.

### Faculty Discrimination and Institutional Racism

**小白** (Little White) reported experiencing discrimination:

> "被东国大老师歧视过🙋"

*Translation: "I was discriminated against by a Dongguk teacher."*

![Student testimony about experiencing discrimination from Dongguk faculty](https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-small-white-experienced-discrimination.png?raw=true)

This indicates a broader pattern of discriminatory behavior by faculty, potentially targeting international students based on nationality or race.

### Culture of Silence and Denial

The comments reveal a concerning culture where male students may be unaware of the sexual violence risks faced by their female peers. **王富贵** noted:

> "不是吧，我朋友圈里还有个这个学院的男研究生，天天发朋友圈说学校多好多好"

*Translation: "Really? I have a male graduate student from this school in my friend circle who posts daily about how great the school is."*

This highlights how sexual violence often remains invisible to those not directly affected, allowing institutions to maintain positive reputations while victims suffer in silence.

## Title IX Compliance Crisis

The viral post detailed Dongguk University's structural sexual violence risks that expose US partner universities to Title IX liability:

- ❌ No independent, safe sexual violence reporting system
- ❌ Zero full-time female professors in graduate film program  
- ❌ Women's student council abolished during Korea's MeToo movement peak (2018)
- ❌ Shared campus space with film company Sidus FNH
- ❌ Documented institutional negligence: 6-month delay after receiving sexual violence report in 2016

## Statistical Evidence of Crisis

The Korean Women's Development Institute's 2020 report confirms **61.5% of female arts students experience sexual violence**, with film programs scoring **81/100 on sexual violence risk assessment**. Dongguk University's unique arrangement sharing campus space with major film company Sidus FNH potentially elevates these risks further.

## Law Enforcement Notification

As documented in the viral post, Korean police and prosecutors were formally notified on May 21, 2025, regarding:

- Falsified international partnerships
- Alleged misuse of public funds
- Sexual violence cover-ups at the Graduate School of Digital Image and Content (Film School)

## International Response

The post details how Canadian universities have officially denied partnerships with Dongguk University, and US universities are re-evaluating collaborations due to Title IX compliance concerns. Global university ranking organizations have escalated the matter to management for review.

## Call for Justice

Our advocacy seeks justice for all victims of sexual violence at Dongguk University, regardless of the nationality, gender, or status of perpetrators and victims. The viral response demonstrates that when victims are given a platform to speak, they will break their silence.

The testimonies emerging from this viral post will be included in additional notifications to Korean prosecutors, as they provide crucial evidence of ongoing sexual violence and institutional negligence at Dongguk University.

We encourage any additional victims or witnesses to continue sharing their experiences safely, as every voice strengthens the case for systemic reform and accountability.

## Second Viral Post: Official International Responses Documented

A second viral post titled "东国大学性暴力危机｜美校警告" (Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis | US University Warning) published at [this URL](https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/683120ed0000000023011821?xsec_token=ABUSUD2yTP5yARfFIrr7EEYxbiioZUCzJMsPOJllsgCpQ=&xsec_source=pc_user) has generated **1533 views, 26 likes and 3 shares with 11 comments**, documenting official responses from international institutions regarding Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis.

### Evidence of Campus Surveillance and Privacy Violations

A particularly disturbing comment from user **Lotus** reveals potential surveillance violations in campus facilities:

> "什么瓜 还有我之前在经营馆女洗手间看到过小孔"

*Translation: "What's this about? Also, I previously saw small holes in the women's bathroom at the business building."*

This testimony suggests potential illegal surveillance of female students in bathroom facilities, representing a severe violation of privacy and potentially criminal activity. Such surveillance would constitute additional sexual violence through voyeurism and create an atmosphere of intimidation for female students.

### Prosecutor Notification Update

These documented official responses and evidence of potential surveillance crimes strengthen the case being presented to Korean prosecutors. The international dimension demonstrates how Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis extends beyond Korean borders and affects global academic integrity.

The combination of falsified partnerships, Title IX compliance failures, and potential criminal surveillance activities presents a comprehensive pattern of institutional corruption that demands immediate investigation and accountability.

Additional victims and witnesses continue to be encouraged to come forward safely, as the international attention ensures their voices will be heard and documented for legal proceedings.

### Update 1:44 AM, May 25, 2025 Beijing time

In just a couple of hours, our viral Xiaohongshu post has skyrocketed from 8,400 to over 13,000 views, with hundreds of shares in Chinese student and parent groups. This post features the NewJeans (NJZ) concert held at Dongguk University in Fall 2024—a symbol of the school's elite entertainment connections—but is now being used by students and parents as a warning. The post exposes Dongguk's ongoing scandals around falsified international partnerships, alleged misuse of public funds, and systemic sexual violence and Title IX non-compliance. You can view the post and the public discussion at this link:

Since the post went viral, multiple victim testimonies have emerged publicly in the comments, and we are witnessing a real-time collapse of Dongguk's Chinese recruitment pipeline. A Canadian university has already officially denied partnership with Dongguk, three U.S. universities are now reevaluating their ties, and global university rankings organizations have escalated the case to management. This is the largest viral backlash against a Korean university this year, with new evidence, testimonies, and engagement continuing to emerge by the hour. Please let me know if you need primary sources, fresh screenshots, or interviews with those affected.

Dear Editor,

I am writing on behalf of Gender Watchdog Research Collective to share our investigation into systemic sexual violence risks at Dongguk University in South Korea, which maintains partnerships with multiple Western institutions. We believe this issue merits coverage in your publication due to its international implications for student safety and institutional accountability.

As advocates connected to international students at Dongguk University, we have observed concerning patterns of trauma-related health impacts among students in connection with documented sexual violence in both the Korean film industry and academic programs. Multiple students have experienced severe physical and psychological symptoms over extended periods, including withdrawal behaviors, academic avoidance, and stress-induced illnesses requiring medical attention. Some students resort to working night shifts despite health concerns, often isolating themselves rather than seeking support. The documented systemic issues within Dongguk's graduate film program and the wider Korean academic sector raise grave concerns of continued sexual violence or coercion on campus. There are additional concerns that international students may be particularly vulnerable targets due to language barriers, cultural differences, and limited support networks.

We wish to submit a risk advisory concerning Dongguk University's graduate film program in Seoul, South Korea — a program currently listed as a partner institution by several U.S. universities.

There is substantial reason to believe that the program exposes female graduate students to persistent, structurally embedded risks of sexual violence, operating within a male-dominated institutional culture that lacks independent reporting systems, protective oversight, or gender balance in faculty representation.

Such environments not only enable sexual violence but compound the psychological harm by systematically denying women safe pathways for disclosure or protection. The absence of transparent support structures magnifies the trauma experienced by victims — creating what experts in trauma psychology identify as institutional betrayal trauma, where the organization's failure to protect becomes a second layer of profound harm.

We understand that U.S. educational institutions have legal obligations under Title IX to ensure that their international partner institutions maintain comparable standards for preventing and addressing sexual harassment and violence. Failure to conduct due diligence regarding the safety of study abroad environments could potentially create legal liability for U.S. institutions, especially when clear risk factors like those at Dongguk University have been documented and reported.

INSTITUTIONAL RISK FACTORS AT DONGGUK UNIVERSITY:

• No visible, independent reporting system for sexual violence and sexual assault
• Zero full-time female faculty in the graduate film program
• Abolition of the Women's Student Council during the height of Korea's MeToo movement (2018)
• Shared campus space with commercial film entities (e.g., Sidus FNH), blurring lines between academic authority and industry power dynamics, creating additional sexual violence risks
• Documented pattern of institutional negligence in responding to sexual assault cases:
  - Took no action for 6 months after being notified in February 2016 about a professor's sexual assault of a student
  - Only implemented a token "professor replacement policy" in August 2016, 9 months after the assault occurred in November 2015
  - Failed to take disciplinary action against the professor until formal prosecution occurred in September 2016
• History of prioritizing institutional reputation over student safety through delayed responses and minimal interventions
• Fundamentally flawed reporting mechanisms:
  - In the 2015 sexual assault case, the victim reported to police rather than university channels, revealing a profound lack of trust in institutional protections
  - The three-month gap between the November 2015 assault and February 2016 university notification demonstrates how institutional barriers prevent timely reporting and intervention
  - Korea's strict hierarchical academic culture creates overwhelming pressure for students to remain silent about faculty misconduct

These structural barriers to reporting mirror findings from the Korean Women's Development Institute's (KWDI) research, which identifies how Korea's Confucian academic tradition creates multiple layers of silencing:

1. Power asymmetry between professors and students is extreme, with professors controlling not only academic outcomes but future career prospects
2. Cultural emphasis on "saving face" prioritizes institutional reputation over victim protection
3. Victims face severe social stigmatization and potential academic retaliation if they report through internal channels
4. The absence of female faculty or student advocacy groups removes crucial support systems that might otherwise facilitate safe reporting

These factors combine to create a statistically high-risk environment for sexual violence, particularly in a country where — according to a 2021 study by the KWDI — arts graduate programs are among the highest-risk environments for sexual violence and sexual abuse by faculty.

RESEARCH CONTEXT: SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN KOREAN ARTS EDUCATION

The 2018 Me Too movement in South Korea revealed alarming levels of sexual violence in arts education. Comprehensive research by the KWDI examining the unique characteristics of sexual violence in arts schools revealed how the apprenticeship model and hierarchical structures create environments where abuse thrives.

In the culture and arts sectors, power dynamics create particularly vulnerable situations:
• Male professors hold disproportionate power despite female students being the majority in most arts departments
• The "artist-mentor" relationship extends beyond normal teaching boundaries
• Professors serve as crucial industry gatekeepers for students' future careers
• "Artistic expression" is often used to justify inappropriate sexual behavior

Sexual violence occurs in multiple settings within arts education:
• Classrooms (through inappropriate examples or demonstrations)
• Research and practice rooms
• Mandatory social gatherings and drinking events
• Private meetings with professors or visiting artists

There is also a growing backlash against the Me Too movement in Korea in an "ongoing anti-feminist wave," so institutions like Dongguk University have regressed on their actual implementation of policies that protect students from sexual violence and sexual abuse by faculty.

NOTABLE CASES OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN KOREAN ARTS ACADEMIA

The issues at Dongguk University are not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of sexual misconduct within Korean arts and academic institutions. Since 2016, numerous high-profile cases have emerged, highlighting systemic problems in hierarchical and male-dominated educational environments:

• Jo Min-ki (Cheongju University, 2018): Actor and professor faced multiple allegations of sexually harassing students. After initially denying the claims, he later admitted to them. Jo died by suicide in March 2018 before formal investigation could be completed.

• Lee Yoon-taek (National Theatre Company, 2018): Prominent theatre director convicted of sexually assaulting nine women under the guise of acting lessons. He was sentenced to six years in prison.

• Myongji College (2018): Four professors from the theatre and visual arts department were dismissed following multiple sexual harassment allegations, including inappropriate physical contact and coercion.

• Korea National University of Arts (K-Arts, 2018): Professor Park Geun-hyung was suspended for three months after allegations of inappropriate behavior towards a student during a school gathering.

• Seoul Institute of the Arts (2018): Reports emerged of a toxic culture involving sexual harassment and bullying, where juniors were coerced into degrading acts during orientations and social gatherings.

• University of Seoul (2018): Professor Park Man-yeop was accused of sexually harassing a student, leading to his suspension and an internal investigation.

• Cho Jae-hyun (Kyungsung University, 2018): Actor and professor faced allegations of sexual misconduct from students, leading to his resignation from the university.

These cases illustrate how hierarchical structures and gender imbalances in Korean academic and cultural institutions create environments vulnerable to abuse. The #MeToo movement in South Korea has been instrumental in bringing these issues to light, yet significant challenges remain in implementing effective reforms.

CALL FOR INSTITUTIONAL REFORM

Given these concerns, we urge partner institutions to consider the following recommendations regarding relationships with Dongguk University:

1. Require Dongguk University to implement meaningful reforms before continuing partnership, including:
   • Hiring female faculty in the graduate film program
   • Reinstating the Women's Student Council
   • Establishing an independent reporting system for sexual violence
   • Creating clear boundaries between academic programs and commercial film entities
   • Publishing transparent data on sexual violence complaints and institutional responses
   • Hiring intimacy coordinators for classrooms and settings where scenes depicting intimacy are taught

2. Conduct risk assessments before sending students to Dongguk University's graduate film program

3. Provide targeted pre-departure training for any students participating in exchange programs with Dongguk University, including information about known risk factors and alternative reporting channels

4. Recognize obligations under Title IX to maintain oversight of partner institutions and ensure that students abroad receive the same level of protection from gender-based discrimination and violence as they would on their home campus

Creating safe educational environments in arts fields requires addressing the unique power dynamics and cultural factors that enable abuse. We believe educational institutions have an important role to play in ensuring high standards for student safety in their international partnerships.

We welcome the opportunity to discuss this investigation with your journalists and can provide additional documentation, background information, and contact with experts in this field. We can be reached at [your contact information].

Dear Editor / Research Team,

We wish to bring to your attention serious ethical and structural concerns surrounding Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea — a school that appears in numerous global university rankings and international academic exchange platforms.

Dongguk’s Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, which oversees its Master’s program in film, presents documented structural risk factors for sexual violence and institutional misrepresentation:🚨 Structural Risk of Sexual Violence in Film Programs

This risk is not theoretical. According to the Korea Women’s Development Institute (KWDI) report titled "Current Status of Sexual Violence Against University Students in the Culture and Arts after the Me Too Movement and Policy Issues", students in arts-focused programs face a statistically higher risk of sexual violence from professors and other authority figures. The study documents:

“Sexual violence by professors against students remains widespread in the culture and arts sectors, and often involves power imbalances, career gatekeeping, and physical proximity during off-campus activities.”

KWDI, 2021, p. 4

At Dongguk University, this risk is compounded by:

An entirely male faculty in its film master's program (as of April 2025)

Physical co-location with commercial film companies such as Sidus FNH, a major entertainment entity

The abolition of the Women’s Student Council during the height of the #MeToo movement in 2018

No visible, independent mechanisms for reporting sexual harassment

These conditions collectively constitute a structural vulnerability, increasing the likelihood of abuse and decreasing the probability that such abuse would be reported or fairly adjudicated.🧾 Confirmed Cases of Institutional Misrepresentation

Despite these red flags, Dongguk continues to publicly list a wide range of U.S., Canadian, and European universities as partners on its official website:

📎 Archived April 8, 2025: Web Archive Snapshot

We have contacted several of these institutions directly. Two examples are especially troubling:

🇨🇦 Canada:

“We do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University. As a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and when you communicate with any journalists or media.”

🇺🇸 United States:

“Greetings,

Thank you for making us aware of this situation. We are undergoing a review of all of our exchange partners and will take this into consideration and will reach out to our partners at Dongguk accordingly.

Please do not quote me in any articles or further emails. Thank you.

Best,”

These responses confirm that some schools currently listed by Dongguk have no active relationship with the university. This suggests possible false advertising of partnerships, which may distort public rankings and mislead international applicants.🔍 What We Urge Your Organization to Do

We respectfully urge your organization to:

Review Dongguk University’s inclusion in rankings or listings that weigh equity, international transparency, partnership integrity, or student safety.

Request clarification from Dongguk University regarding its listed international partners and the steps it has taken to mitigate structural sexual violence risk.

Consider issuing a formal caution or suspension notice to Dongguk in future rankings or institutional profiles until minimum equity and safety standards are met.

This is a live and ongoing situation, and more university denials are expected in the coming weeks. We would be happy to provide additional documentation upon request.

Sincerely,
