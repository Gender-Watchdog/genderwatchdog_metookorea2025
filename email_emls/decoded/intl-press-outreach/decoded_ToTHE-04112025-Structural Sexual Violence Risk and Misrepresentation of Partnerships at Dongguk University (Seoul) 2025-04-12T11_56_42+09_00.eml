Dear Editor / Research Team,

We wish to bring to your attention serious ethical and structural concerns surrounding Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea — a school that appears in numerous global university rankings and international academic exchange platforms.

Dongguk’s Graduate School of Digital Media and Contents, which oversees its Master’s program in film, presents documented structural risk factors for sexual violence and institutional misrepresentation:🚨 Structural Risk of Sexual Violence in Film Programs

This risk is not theoretical. According to the Korea Women’s Development Institute (KWDI) report titled "Current Status of Sexual Violence Against University Students in the Culture and Arts after the Me Too Movement and Policy Issues", students in arts-focused programs face a statistically higher risk of sexual violence from professors and other authority figures. The study documents:

“Sexual violence by professors against students remains widespread in the culture and arts sectors, and often involves power imbalances, career gatekeeping, and physical proximity during off-campus activities.”

KWDI, 2021, p. 4

At Dongguk University, this risk is compounded by:

An entirely male faculty in its film master's program (as of April 2025)

Physical co-location with commercial film companies such as Sidus FNH, a major entertainment entity

The abolition of the Women’s Student Council during the height of the #MeToo movement in 2018

No visible, independent mechanisms for reporting sexual harassment

These conditions collectively constitute a structural vulnerability, increasing the likelihood of abuse and decreasing the probability that such abuse would be reported or fairly adjudicated.🧾 Confirmed Cases of Institutional Misrepresentation

Despite these red flags, Dongguk continues to publicly list a wide range of U.S., Canadian, and European universities as partners on its official website:

📎 Archived April 8, 2025: Web Archive Snapshot

We have contacted several of these institutions directly. Two examples are especially troubling:

🇨🇦 Canada:

“We do not have a student exchange agreement with Dongguk University. As a result, please DO NOT include our institution in the article and when you communicate with any journalists or media.”

🇺🇸 United States:

“Greetings,

Thank you for making us aware of this situation. We are undergoing a review of all of our exchange partners and will take this into consideration and will reach out to our partners at Dongguk accordingly.

Please do not quote me in any articles or further emails. Thank you.

Best,”

These responses confirm that some schools currently listed by Dongguk have no active relationship with the university. This suggests possible false advertising of partnerships, which may distort public rankings and mislead international applicants.🔍 What We Urge Your Organization to Do

We respectfully urge your organization to:

Review Dongguk University’s inclusion in rankings or listings that weigh equity, international transparency, partnership integrity, or student safety.

Request clarification from Dongguk University regarding its listed international partners and the steps it has taken to mitigate structural sexual violence risk.

Consider issuing a formal caution or suspension notice to Dongguk in future rankings or institutional profiles until minimum equity and safety standards are met.

This is a live and ongoing situation, and more university denials are expected in the coming weeks. We would be happy to provide additional documentation upon request.

Sincerely,
Gender Watchdog
