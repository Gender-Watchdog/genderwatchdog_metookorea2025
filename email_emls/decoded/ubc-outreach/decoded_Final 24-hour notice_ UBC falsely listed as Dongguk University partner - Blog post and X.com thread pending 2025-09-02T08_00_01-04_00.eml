Dear
University Administration and Student Union Leadership,

This
is our final notice before publishing a blog post and X.com thread
documenting that UBC is falsely listed as a partner by Dongguk
University, despite UBC's official partnerships page showing no such
relationship.Timeline
Summary

April
	10, 2025:
	We notified 7 Korean government agencies about falsified
	partnerships and sexual violence risks at Dongguk University (145
	days of silence)

April
	27, 2025:
	We notified the Canadian Embassy in Seoul and Global Affairs Canada
	(128 days of silence)

August
	27, 2025 08:00:
	We emailed university administrations with evidence and 72-hour
	right of reply

August
	30, 2025 08:00:
	We emailed student unions after administrative non-response

September
	2, 2025:
	Final 24-hour notice before publicationWhat
We've Verified

UBC's
official "Current partnerships" page does not list Dongguk
University under South Korea:

Live
	page: https://global.ubc.ca/partner-ubc/current-partnerships

Web
	archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20250902055312/https://global.ubc.ca/partner-ubc/current-partnerships

Archive.today: https://archive.md/jdNOp

Dongguk
University's official partner page lists UBC among partners:

	page: https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

Earlier
	archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20250408154026/https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

This
is the second
falsified Canadian partnership we
have documented on Dongguk's site. (Note: The university that
requested we not mention their name to journalists or media - your
request continues to be honored.)What
Our Blog Post Will Detail

Our
pending blog post "Second Falsified Partnership on Dongguk
University's Website: UBC Not Listed by UBC — 145 Days of Silence"
will document:

Partnership
	verification failure:
	UBC's South Korea partnerships section shows multiple institutions
	but not Dongguk

IEQAS
	certification compromise:
	How falsified partnerships prove Korea's International Education
	Quality Assurance System cannot be trusted

Buddhist
	ethics contradiction:
	How Dongguk's claimed Buddhist affiliation conflicts with 145+ days
	of deceptive partner listings

Timeline
	of institutional silence:
	Complete documentation of non-response from universities and
	governments

Risk
	baseline:
	Korean government data showing 61.5% of women in arts/culture
	programs experience sexual violenceSpecific
Questions for Your Response

For
University Administrations:

	Have
	you contacted Dongguk University requesting delisting from their
	partner page?

	Have
	you notified the Canadian Embassy in Seoul or Global Affairs Canada
	about this misrepresentation?

	Will
	you issue an interim student advisory about disputed partnerships
	and safety risks?

	Do
	you have any active agreement (exchange, mobility, MOU) with Dongguk
	University?

For
Student Unions:

	Have
	you contacted your administration demanding action on this 6+ day
	non-response?

	Will
	you issue independent safety alerts to students considering Korea
	programs?

	Have
	you coordinated with other affected student unions listed on
	Dongguk's fraudulent partner page?Why
This Matters Beyond One University

Falsified
partner claims:

	Mislead
	students and families about support structures abroad

	Inflate
	institutional legitimacy for recruitment and funding

	Compromise
	due-diligence by foreign universities and ranking bodies

	Enable
	systematic exploitation of international students in high-risk
	environmentsNext
