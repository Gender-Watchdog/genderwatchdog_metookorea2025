Dear International Office,

I am writing to inform you of escalating gender equity and structural risk concerns at Dongguk University in Seoul, South Korea ‚Äî an institution publicly listed as one of your academic partners:

üëâ https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/page/554

More than three weeks have passed since I first raised these issues directly with Dongguk University on March 14, 2025. An updated version of that report was subsequently circulated to other Asian partner institutions on March 15 to highlight potential risks affecting both domestic and international students, including exchange participants from North America.

As there has been no formal response from Dongguk University to date, I am following up with a consolidated summary of the most critical concerns. These include:

A persistent lack of gender diversity in faculty appointments (notably, an all-male graduate film program)

Heightened structural vulnerabilities due to the graduate school‚Äôs physical proximity to industry entities (e.g., Sidus FNH)

Ongoing gaps in curriculum transparency, student protections, and institutional accountability1.
2016: Professor Replacement Policy

Dongguk
introduced a progressive rule in 2016 allowing students to request a
different professor if they experienced verbal or sexual abuse:

	https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2016/08/05/socialAffairs/Dongguk-University-changes-policy-to-help-students-who-suffer-verbal-or-sexual-abuse/3022260.html

This
was a promising step to address power imbalances in academia.

Questions:

	Has any student successfully invoked this professor replacement
	policy?

	Is the policy still actively enforced in 2025, particularly in the
	Graduate School of Digital Image & Contents?2.
2018: MeToo Movement & Abolition of the Women‚Äôs Student Council

During
the height of the MeToo movement in 2018, Dongguk abolished its
Women‚Äôs Student Council ‚Äî previously a key advocacy group for
female students:

please download the website .html files and other files from

Questions:

	Why was this student-led body dismantled during a period of
	heightened global awareness around sexual harassment?

	Has Dongguk created any alternative group or mechanism to protect
	and represent female students?3.
2025: All-Male Faculty & Lack of Transparent Policies

As
of 2025, the Master‚Äôs in Film program remains entirely male,
according to Dongguk‚Äôs official site:

	https://www.dongguk.edu/eng/dandae/122#;

This
creates significant power imbalances and raises the risk of unchecked
misconduct. Contextual data includes:

	Professors are often the main perpetrators of sexual abuse in Korean
	graduate schools

		https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2021/06/181_309773.html

	Korean universities grant excessive power to professors, increasing
	student vulnerability

		https://m.koreaherald.com/article/3223926

	High prevalence of sexual harassment and violence in universities

		https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2025/03/715_311172.html

	Gender discrimination in the Korean film industry, from the Center
	for Gender Equality in Film

		http://solido.kr/eng/

	Post-MeToo study on harassment in arts education programs

Key
Questions:

	How does Dongguk justify having zero female faculty while claiming
	to uphold harassment prevention policies?

	Without a Women‚Äôs Student Council, how can female or exchange
	students safely report misconduct?

	Is the 2016 professor replacement policy still operational and
	publicly visible to students?4.
On-Campus Industry Exposure & Structural Vulnerabilities

It
has come to light that Sidus FNH, one of Korea‚Äôs top film
production companies, shares physical space with the graduate school
program.

This
shared space radically increases the risk of boundary violations,
especially when:

	Students and industry staff interact informally in elevators,
	cafeterias, or shared hallways

	Students may feel pressure to network with powerful men who can
	influence their future employment

	There is no formal oversight of these interactions, nor structured
	protections for students (e.g., chaperoning, reporting mechanisms,
	professional boundaries)

The
risk for sexual harassment, inappropriate recruitment practices, and
psychological grooming is exacerbated in environments where:

	Young women are dependent on connections

	All-male faculty reinforce hierarchical silence

	Industry insiders walk freely among vulnerable students

This
arrangement is not just negligent ‚Äî it is dangerous.

Hoesik
Risks:

Women in Korea are increasingly refusing to
attend post-class or work drinking parties (hoesik) due to the risk
of harassment:

	https://www.koreaherald.com/article/2900363

	https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15546832

Yet
without female faculty, ombudspersons, or safe reporting, students at
Dongguk may feel pressured to attend these gatherings, particularly
when linked to career advancement.5.
Institutional Inaction Despite Known Risk Factors

Combined
with:

	The dissolution of the Women‚Äôs Student Council in 2018

	The lack of female faculty members

	And the absence of transparency around sexual harassment reporting
	history

‚Ä¶it
is clear that Dongguk University is failing to maintain basic gender
equity safeguards in line with global academic and labor standards.

A
growing body of international research confirms that gender-diverse
faculties contribute to better outcomes for all students ‚Äî
not just female or international learners. For reference, please see
this report: üëâ
https://drive.proton.me/urls/9GZC1335ZM#MyrCIqaix95o6.
Symbolic Curriculum Bias: French Over English

The
program emphasizes French language, while offering no
English-language training or support ‚Äî despite English being the
dominant language in global cinema:

	English is used in international co-productions, global grants, and
	film festivals

	Most international film industry networking, policy discourse, and
	distribution occurs in English

Questions:

	Why is there no English-language component in the curriculum?

	Does this decision reflect a male-centric fantasy about cinema
	rather than a practical learning objective?

This
curriculum imbalance reflects:

	Aesthetic elitism over employability

	Coded masculinity hidden behind ‚Äútaste‚Äù and ‚Äútradition‚Äù

	Lack of commitment to real-world career preparation for both female
	and international students7.
"Policies Without Gender Balance Are Structural Performance, Not
Protection"

Dongguk‚Äôs
sexual harassment policy framework‚Äîwhile strong on paper‚Äîis
structurally undermined by:

	Zero female faculty

	No women-led oversight

	A dissolved student council

	No published harassment data

As
the Korean Women‚Äôs Association United has stated:

‚ÄúUniversities often establish sexual violence committees only as a
formality ‚Äî without transparency, accountability, or protection for
victims.‚Äù

This
is consistent with well-documented cases at Seoul National
University, Yonsei, and Chung-Ang.

In
this system:

	Female students face retaliation and reputational risk for speaking
	up

	International women may fear for visas, careers, or grades

	Male professors are effectively unaccountable

These
are not safeguards. These are institutional liabilities masquerading
as ethics.Requested
Response

We
respectfully request answers to the following:

	Clarification on how the 2016 ‚Äúprofessor replacement‚Äù policy is
	enforced in 2025.

	Explanation for the abolition of the Women‚Äôs Student Council in
	2018, and whether any replacement body exists.

	What steps Dongguk is taking to address the all-male faculty
	composition in the Master‚Äôs in Film program.

	What safeguards exist to prevent exploitation or harassment
	involving Sidus FNH collaborations.

	Clarification on the curricular decision to prioritize French cinema
	while excluding English-language cinema.

	Whether Dongguk maintains any harassment reporting data, and if so,
	whether it is publicly available.Request
for Accountability

We
again urge:

	Formal inquiry by partner institutions abroad

	Suspension of academic partnerships with Dongguk University until
	gender equity reforms are implemented

	Public disclosure of harassment reporting data and faculty gender
	balance over the last 5 years

Given
the international community‚Äôs growing commitment to gender
equality, we believe Dongguk University must clarify whether its
policies, faculty structure, and academic culture meet global
standards for a safe and inclusive educational environment.

We
look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
Gender
Watchdog
