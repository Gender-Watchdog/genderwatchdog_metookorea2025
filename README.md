## Project Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Gender Watchdog project documenting cases of sexual violence, institutional cover-ups, and misuse of public funds at Korean universities, particularly Dongguk University. Our goal is to make visible the issues of sexual violence in university settings, provide resources to survivors, and demand institutional accountability.
