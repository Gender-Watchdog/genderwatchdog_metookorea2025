# Legal Hardening & Project Status

## 1. Truthful Posture Assessment
**Status:** Pre-incorporation Social Enterprise

This project is an independently funded initiative focused on AI-assisted transparency in university administration. It is a "social enterprise" in the pre-incorporation phase, building tools for civic technology and whistleblowing.

*   **We are NOT a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) or a registered non-profit charity.**
*   We do not solicit donations as a tax-exempt entity.
*   We do not claim official government authority or accreditation status.

Our funding is personal and autonomous to ensure objectivity and independence from conflicting interests.

## 2. Standard Disclaimer
> "This project conducts independent research and analysis using AI-assisted methodology. It does not provide legal advice, victim services, or official accreditation judgments. All findings are based on publicly available information and documented correspondence. Users are encouraged to independently verify all data."

## 3. Partner Liability Shield
> "While we acknowledge the moral support of End Rape On Campus (EROC) and other institutional supporters, this project is operationally independent. Supporters provide no funding, editorial direction, or oversight, and bear no liability for findings."
