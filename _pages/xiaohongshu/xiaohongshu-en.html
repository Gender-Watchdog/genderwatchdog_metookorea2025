                <p>This viral post has provided a safe space for victims to share their experiences, revealing patterns of institutional failure and victim silencing at Dongguk University.</p>
                <h4>Theatre Department Self-Censorship: Evidence of Fear and Retaliation</h4>
                <p>A Theatre Department user <b>[redacted]</b> initially left a meaningful comment but later edited it, demonstrating fear of criticizing Dongguk University.</p>
                <p><b>Original Comment:</b><br>"波澜背后的痛小透明的哭泣孤独，而且我们大谈特谈feminism。"<br><i>Translation: "Behind all the drama, there are quiet tears and loneliness of the nameless ones, yet we endlessly talk about feminism."</i></p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-solidarity-feminism-redacted.png?raw=true" alt="Theatre student's original comment about pain and loneliness" class="img-fluid rounded shadow my-3">
                <p><b>Edited Comment:</b><br>"戏剧学暂时没有认识的男教授，而且我们大谈特谈 Fimines"<br><i>Translation: "Theatre Department currently has no male professors that I know of, and we talk a lot about feminism."</i></p>
                <img src="https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-theatre-student-no-male-profs-edit-redacted.png?raw=true" alt="Self-censored comment after removing mentions of pain and isolation" class="img-fluid rounded shadow my-3">
                <p>This dramatic self-censorship reveals critical issues:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fear of Retaliation</b>: The commenter deleted all references to "pain," "tears," and "loneliness," showing fear that speaking honestly about campus conditions could lead to identification or consequences.</li>
                    <li><b>Institutional Intimidation</b>: The atmosphere that compels students to delete negative experiences suggests that criticism is dangerous.</li>
                    <li><b>Hidden Suffering</b>: The original comment revealed that despite active feminist discourse in the Theatre Department, students are experiencing significant emotional distress.</li>
                    <li><b>Performative vs. Substantive Change</b>: The contrast between "endlessly talking about feminism" and students suffering in silence suggests discussions may not translate to actual protection or support.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Inappropriate Questions During Admissions Interviews</h4>
                <p>User <b>[redacted]</b> shared a direct experience with a Dongguk University professor:</p>
                <blockquote>"em...我以前读研的时候 面试我的是个东大的教授. 两名里面其中一名 问的问题 就不是面试问题. 有关我个人隐私的 第一直觉告诉我 得跑 录取上后我直接退学了"<br><i>Translation: "When I was applying for graduate school, I was interviewed by a Dongguk University professor. One of the two asked questions that weren't interview questions, but about my personal privacy. My instinct told me to run, and after being accepted, I immediately withdrew."</i></blockquote>

                <blockquote>"被东国大老师歧视过🙋"<br><i>Translation: "I've experienced discrimination by a Dongguk University professor."</i></blockquote>
                <img src="https://github.com/Gender-Watchdog/genderwatchdog_metookorea2025/blob/master/imgs/xiaohongshu/for-blog-comments-and-stats-xiahongshu/05242025-dongguk-faculty-racial-discrimination-intl-student-redacted.png?raw=true" alt="Student testimony about experiencing discrimination by Dongguk professor" class="img-fluid rounded shadow my-3">
                <h4>Culture of Silence and Denial</h4>
                <p>Comments reveal a troubling culture where male students remain unaware of the sexual violence risks faced by their female peers. <b>[redacted] (Wang Fugui)</b> noted:</p>
                <blockquote>"不是吧，我朋友圈里还有个这个学院的男研究生，天天发朋友圈说学校多好多好"<br><i>Translation: "Really? I have a male graduate student from this school in my social circle who posts daily about how great the school is."</i></blockquote>
                <h3>Title IX Compliance Crisis</h3>
                <p>This viral post details how Dongguk University's structural sexual violence risks could create Title IX legal liability for collaborating U.S. universities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>❌ No independent, safe sexual violence reporting system</li>
                    <li>❌ Zero tenured female faculty in Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents (Film Department)</li>
                    <li>❌ Dissolution of Women's Student Association at height of 2018 #MeToo movement</li>
                    <li>❌ Shared campus space with Sidus FNH film company</li>
                    <li>❌ No action for 6 months after 2016 faculty sexual violence report</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Statistical Evidence of Crisis</h3>
                <p>According to the 2020 Korean Women's Development Institute (KWDI) report, <b>61.5% of female students in arts programs experience sexual violence</b>, with Film Departments rated at <b>81/100 sexual violence risk</b>. Dongguk University is the only university sharing campus space with major film company Sidus FNH, potentially elevating actual risk even higher.</p>
                <h3>Law Enforcement Notification</h3>
                <p>As documented in the viral post, on May 21, 2025, Korean police and prosecution were officially notified of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Falsified international partnership relationships</li>
                    <li>Suspected misuse of public funds</li>
                    <li>Sexual violence cover-ups within Graduate School of Digital Image and Contents (Film Department)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>International Response</h3>
                <p>The post shows that Canadian universities have officially denied partnerships with Dongguk, U.S. universities have begun reviewing collaborations for Title IX compliance issues, and global university rating agencies have reported the matter to executive leadership.</p>
                <h3>Call for Justice</h3>
                <p>Our advocacy aims to achieve justice for all sexual violence victims at Dongguk University, regardless of perpetrator or victim nationality, gender, or status. The viral response proves that when victims are given platforms to speak, silence breaks.</p>
                <p>Testimonies from this viral post will be included in additional prosecutorial notifications regarding Dongguk University's ongoing sexual violence and institutional malfeasance.</p>
                <p>Additional victims and witnesses are encouraged to safely share their experiences. Every voice strengthens the case for structural reform and accountability.</p>
                <hr>
                <h2>Second Viral Post: Documenting Official International Response</h2>
                <p>A second viral post titled "东国大学性暴力危机｜美校警告" (Dongguk University Sexual Violence Crisis | U.S. University Warning) can be viewed at <a href="https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore/683120ed0000000023011821?xsec_token=ABUSUD2yTP5yARfFIrr7EEYxbiioZUCzJMsPOJllsgCpQ=&xsec_source=pc_user" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> and documented official international institutional responses with <b>1,561 views, 3 likes, 92 bookmarks, and 26 comments</b>.</p>
                <h4>Campus Illegal Filming and Privacy Violation Evidence</h4>
                <p>User <b>[redacted]</b> left a shocking comment revealing illegal filming activities in campus facilities:</p>
                <blockquote>"什么瓜 还有我之前在经营馆女洗手间看到过小孔"<br><i>Translation: "What's going on? And I previously saw small holes in the women's restroom in the Business Building."</i></blockquote>
                <h4>Prosecutorial Notification Update</h4>
                <p>These official responses and evidence of illegal filming crimes further strengthen the basis for prosecutorial complaints against Dongguk University. They demonstrate that Dongguk's sexual violence crisis is impacting global academic trust beyond Korea's borders.</p>
                <p>The falsified partnerships, Title IX non-compliance, and illegal filming represent a comprehensive pattern of institutional corruption requiring immediate investigation and accountability.</p>
                <p>Additional victims and witnesses are encouraged to continue safely sharing their experiences. With heightened international attention, every voice becomes crucial evidence in legal proceedings.</p>
                <hr>

                <h4>Comprehensive Stakeholder Network</h4>

                <h4>Pressure Effect Amplification</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Diplomatic Consequences:</b> Foreign embassies receiving evidence of sexual violence risks affecting their nationals creates immediate diplomatic pressure on Korean authorities to investigate and respond.</li>
                    <li><b>International Academic Isolation:</b> Global universities and educational institutions receiving information simultaneously prevents Dongguk from controlling narratives or limiting damage to specific regions.</li>
                    <li><b>Media Amplification:</b> Coordinated distribution to Korean and international media prevents domestic suppression of the story while maintaining international visibility.</li>
                    <li><b>Legal Accountability:</b> U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights receiving evidence enables potential Title IX enforcement actions against U.S. universities collaborating with Dongguk.</li>
                    <li><b>Advocacy Network Activation:</b> International sexual violence prevention organizations receiving information mobilizes global advocacy resources and expertise.</li>
                    <li><b>Government Agency Coordination:</b> Multiple Korean ministries and agencies receiving identical evidence prevents bureaucratic avoidance and creates internal pressure for coordinated response.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Immediate Impact</h4>
                <p>This strategic distribution transforms an isolated viral social media post into a coordinated international incident requiring immediate institutional response. The 43 days of government silence documented in the viral posts becomes increasingly unsustainable as diplomatic, academic, and advocacy pressure increases simultaneously from multiple directions.</p>
                <p>The comprehensive stakeholder engagement ensures that Dongguk University's sexual violence crisis and falsified partnership relationships cannot be contained as a domestic Korean issue, but must be addressed as an international academic integrity and student safety crisis affecting multiple countries and institutions.</p>
                <p>This pressure matrix demonstrates how viral social media evidence, when strategically distributed to appropriate stakeholders, can create accountability mechanisms that transcend institutional and national boundaries to demand justice for sexual violence victims.</p>
